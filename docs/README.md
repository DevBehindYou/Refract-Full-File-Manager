## 1. Product vision

A file manager that a beginner can open and immediately understand, and that a power user
never outgrows. It looks like nothing else on Android because its chrome is built from a
custom **Liquid Glass** rendering system that refracts the content behind it rather than
merely blurring it — but the glass is confined to navigation and interactive surfaces, and
it degrades cleanly on every device down to Android 8.1.

**One sentence:** *Simple by default, powerful when needed, and never unsafe with your files.*

## 2. Non-negotiable engineering priority order

```text
1. File safety            — never lose or corrupt user data
2. Reliability            — never crash, never leave an operation half-done silently
3. Correct storage behaviour — obey Scoped Storage, SAF, and Play policy honestly
4. Performance            — 60fps scroll, instant folder open
5. Accessibility          — TalkBack, contrast, reduced motion/transparency
6. Usability              — discoverable, low-friction
7. Visual polish          — spacing, type, motion
8. Advanced visual effects — shaders, refraction, highlights
```

Anything in 7–8 that threatens 1–4 is deleted, not optimised. This ordering is enforced in
code review and in [`AI_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md`](AI_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md).

## 3. The three hard Android truths this project is built around

These are researched in [`ANDROID_STORAGE_RESEARCH.md`](ANDROID_STORAGE_RESEARCH.md).
Ignoring any one of them produces an app that fails review or fails on device.

1. **There is no single storage API that works across API 27–37.** Legacy `File` I/O works
   on 27–28, is fenced by Scoped Storage from 29, and from 30 requires either
   `MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` or SAF. The app therefore has **three storage backends behind
   one interface**, selected at runtime.
2. **`MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` does not grant unlimited access.** Even when granted, on API
   30+ the app cannot write into `/Android/data` or `/Android/obb`, and access to those
   paths via SAF is blocked from API 30 (fully from API 33 the picker refuses those trees).
   Any UI implying "full access" is a lie and a support burden.
3. **Blur is not free and not universal.** True background sampling requires `RuntimeShader`
   (API 33+). API 32 can approximate with layered `GraphicsLayer`s. API 31 has
   `RenderEffect` but with known artefacts. Below that, only scrims and gradients.
   Hence the three-tier renderer in [`LIQUID_GLASS_RESEARCH.md`](LIQUID_GLASS_RESEARCH.md).

## 4. Architecture at a glance

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    UI["Compose UI<br/>(stateless, no logic)"] --> VM["ViewModel<br/>(StateFlow + SharedFlow)"]
    VM --> UC["Use Cases<br/>(domain, pure Kotlin)"]
    UC --> REPO["Repositories<br/>(interfaces in domain)"]
    REPO --> DS["Data Sources<br/>File / SAF / MediaStore / Room / DataStore"]
    DS --> API["Android Storage APIs"]
```

* Domain layer is pure Kotlin — no `android.*` imports, no `java.io.File` leaking upward.
* Every file, wherever it lives, is a **`FileNode`** — see
  [`architecture/STORAGE_ARCHITECTURE.md`](architecture/STORAGE_ARCHITECTURE.md).
* Every mutation goes through the **File Operations Engine** — see
  [`architecture/FILE_OPERATIONS.md`](architecture/FILE_OPERATIONS.md).
* Every permission request goes through **`StorageAccessManager`** — see
  [`architecture/PERMISSIONS.md`](architecture/PERMISSIONS.md).

## 5. Module structure

Single Gradle module for MVP (`:app`), with **package-level enforcement** of the same
boundaries. Modularisation is deferred to V1 and justified in
[`architecture/MODULES.md`](architecture/MODULES.md). Do not create fifteen Gradle modules
before there is a build-time reason to.

```text
com.devbehindyou.refract
├── core.designsystem     // tokens, theme, glass renderer
├── core.ui               // shared composables, previews
├── core.common           // Result types, dispatchers, extensions
├── core.database         // Room entities, DAOs

├── data                  // repository impls, storage backends, mappers
└── feature.{home,browse,search,storage,preview,operations,settings,permissions}
```

## 6. Design system and Liquid Glass

* All visual values come from semantic tokens. No hard-coded `dp`, colour, or blur radius
  anywhere in feature code — [`DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`](DESIGN_SYSTEM.md).
* Glass appears on: bottom bar, search bar, toolbars, sheets, dialogs, context menus,
  selection bar, FAB. **Not** on list rows, not on backgrounds, not on text containers.
* `GlassCapabilityManager` resolves a `GlassTier` (A / B / C) from API level, GPU class,
  RAM, thermal status, battery saver, and accessibility settings, and all glass composables
  read it — [`LIQUID_GLASS_RESEARCH.md`](LIQUID_GLASS_RESEARCH.md).
* Layout, hit targets, and information hierarchy are **identical across tiers**. Only the
  material changes.

## 8. Development rules (summary — full list in CODING_RULES.md)

1. Kotlin only. Compose only. No XML layouts, no Fragments beyond the single Activity.
2. No business logic in a `@Composable`. Composables take state + lambdas.
3. UI state is an immutable `data class`; events are a sealed interface.
4. ViewModels never touch `java.io.File`, `ContentResolver`, or `DocumentFile`.
5. No disk I/O on the main thread, ever. `Dispatchers.IO` + `withContext`.
6. Streaming I/O only. Never `readBytes()` on a user file.
7. Every destructive action is confirmed, reversible, or both.
8. Every dependency must be justified in [`TECH_STACK.md`](TECH_STACK.md).
9. Accessibility is written at the same time as the composable, not after.
10. Guard every API-level-gated call with a documented constant, never a raw integer.

## 10. Where to start coding

Do **not** start at the UI. Start at Phase 1 in
[`roadmap/IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md`](roadmap/IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md):
project skeleton → `FileNode` + backends → browse → operations. The glass system is
**Phase 8**, deliberately late, and it must be droppable without touching feature code.
