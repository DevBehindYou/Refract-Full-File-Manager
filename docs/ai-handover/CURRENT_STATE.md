Confidence: HIGH for code and CI. LOW for on-device behaviour, which has not been run since 15 Sep 2026.

## Build

All CI gates on `main` are green: ktlint, detekt, Lint, unit and Robolectric tests, and the debug and R8 release APKs. Release is debug-signed (ISS-001).

## Git

- Branch: `main`
- Commit: `e2b1509`
- Open PRs: none after this handover merges.
- Agents work on `claude/<topic>` branches. A merged branch is never reused.

## Workarounds

- R8: `-dontwarn org.ietf.jgss.**`, `javax.security.auth.login.**` (for sshj).
- BouncyCastle pinned to 1.86 (ADR-005).
- The mount receiver is exported (ADR-006).

## Open blockers

- No device or emulator was available to the agent. Every P0 task in `PENDING.md` needs one.
- Production signing and the Play policy review need the owner.
