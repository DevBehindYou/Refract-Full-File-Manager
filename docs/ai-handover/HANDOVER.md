## Goal

An all-in-one Android file manager without clutter, following `docs/roadmap/ALL_IN_ONE_PLAN.md`.

## Current status

| Area | Status |
|---|---|
| Build (CI) | VERIFIED |
| Unit and Robolectric tests | VERIFIED (about 535) |
| Device and instrumented tests | UNKNOWN (manual job not run on current code) |
| Runtime on a phone | UNKNOWN since 15 Sep 2026 |
| Release signing | BROKEN: debug key (ISS-001) |
| Plan Phases 0–4 | IMPLEMENTED |
| §16 optimization | PARTIAL |

## Completed

All plan features: see `CHANGES.md`, CHG-001 to CHG-023.

## Active problems

- ISS-001: no production signing key.
- ISS-002: device-only behaviour has never run on hardware.

## Highest-priority work

TASK-001 (run the emulator job), then TASK-002 (baseline profile), then the hardware checks TASK-003 to TASK-005.

## Critical constraints

- One PR per task. Merge only when CI is green and there is no conflict.
- Every mutation goes through `FileOperationsEngine` and the journal. Trash is the default.
- Plain-language UI. Never fake an Android capability that isn't there.
- Never weaken or skip a test.
