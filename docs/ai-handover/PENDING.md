# Pending

Last updated: 2026-10-08

All of plan Phases 0 to 4 are merged. What is left needs a real device, the owner, or is optional. The order below is the recommended order.

## P0 — device verification (needs a phone or emulator)

### TASK-001 — Run the manual emulator CI job once

Status: OPEN

Why: It is the only automated run of the device tests, the release launch, the 10,000-event monkey test (PR #39), and R8 at runtime.

Action: GitHub → Actions → CI → "Run workflow" on `main`. The job is `instrumented-tests` in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

Done when: The job is green. If the monkey test fails, `monkey.log` shows the crash, and it is fixed.

### TASK-002 — Generate and commit the baseline profile

Status: OPEN

Files: `benchmark/.../BaselineProfileGenerator.kt` (the run command is in its KDoc), and the target `app/src/main/baseline-prof.txt`.

Action:

1. Run the generator on an API 33+ emulator.
2. Copy the `*-baseline-prof.txt` output.
3. Commit it.
4. Re-run `StartupBenchmark`, and record cold start before and after in plan §16.1.

Done when: The profile ships in the release APK and the startup numbers are recorded.

### TASK-003 — Network features on real hardware

Status: OPEN

Action: On the same Wi-Fi:

1. Connect to an SMB share (Windows or Samba), browse it, copy both ways, and check that a wrong password gives a clear message.
2. Run mDNS discovery (`NsdServerDiscovery`) and confirm it finds the server.
3. Start Wi-Fi share, open the URL on a PC, enter the PIN, then download and upload (uploads on). Confirm it stops on leave, on Stop, and after 15 minutes idle.

Done when: Each passes, or a bug is filed or fixed with a test.

### TASK-004 — USB OTG checklist

Status: OPEN

Action: Work through `docs/testing/USB_OTG_CHECKLIST.md` with a FAT32 and an exFAT drive. Include unplugging mid-copy.

### TASK-005 — A real process kill mid-copy

Status: OPEN

Action:

1. Start a copy of a file of 1 GB or more to the SD card.
2. Run `adb shell am kill com.devbehindyou.atomicfilemanager`, or force-stop.
3. Reopen the app.

Expected: The resume prompt appears, there is no partial file under the real name, and Resume finishes with a matching checksum.

Done when: The plan §16.8 "Process-kill tests" row no longer says "real-device kill run is still to do".

## P1 — owner decisions and actions

### TASK-006 — Check Play policy for Shizuku and all-files access

Status: OPEN (owner)

Why: Plan §12 risk register. Shizuku (PR #36) and `MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` both need declarations.

Files: `docs/architecture/PERMISSIONS.md` §7.

### TASK-007 — Production signing

Status: OPEN (owner). See ISS-001.

## P2 — optimization left in plan §16 (each must come with a measurement)

| ID | Item | Where | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| TASK-010 | Drop the category walk when the index is fresh | `PhoneFileIndex`, `RoomSearchIndex` | Needs `MediaStore.getGeneration` freshness first (ADR-004) |
| TASK-011 | Keep the analysis result across restarts, and rescan incrementally | `StorageAnalyzerUseCase` | Today it is in memory for 10 minutes only (PR #40) |
| TASK-012 | Split `MainActivity.kt` (958 lines), and measure Browse recomposition | `MainActivity.kt`, `ui/screens/Browse*.kt` | `BrowseScreen` was split in PR #41; use Layout Inspector recomposition counts |
| TASK-013 | Large-data test: 100,000 files, a 4 GB file, a 10,000-entry folder | new JVM or device test | Needed to check the §16.1 budgets |
| TASK-014 | Network: resume interrupted transfers (FTP `REST`, WebDAV `Range`, SFTP offset) | `data/backend/network/*` | Connection pooling and reconnect are already in SFTP and SMB |
| TASK-015 | APK size report in CI | `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | Fail on unexplained growth |
| TASK-016 | Measure copy speed on SD and USB with the 256 KB buffer | device | PR #38 only changed the constant |

## Optional

- Migrate transfer bubbles and hidden files from SQLiteOpenHelper to Room. Both already load on IO, so this is about tidiness, not speed.
- Add more device rows to `docs/testing/DEVICE_MATRIX.md`: API 27, 29, 30, 33 and 36, plus a tablet and a foldable. So far only an API 34 phone.
